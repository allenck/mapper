<h1>Overlays</h1>

When locating the route of a long-gone streetcar line, often the route
traveled on private right of way which since has been obscured by
subsequent construction. Also, street alignments may have been changed
or eliminated due to highway construction, urban renewal or other
activities. In such cases, having access to historical maps as an
overlay will allow you to locate exactly where a route ran. <br>
<p>An overlay is a map that can be displayed with variable transparency on top of the main map (in Mapper either Google Maps or Open Street Map).</p>

<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="column left" style="background-color:#EFDECD;">
<h2>Overlay Management</h2>
<p>Mappers overlays are managed with the <i>Manage Overlays</i> menu selection accessed from the <i>City</i> menu. This selection will display: 

<p>In this dialog, you can:</p><ol>
<li>alter the coordinates of the center</li>
<li>alter properties on defined overlays</li>
<li>select which overlay can be used for a city,</li>
<li>add a new overlay by pressing the <i>Add Overlay</i> button</li>
</ol>

<h2>Adding Overlays</h2>
<p>There are three ways to acquire overlays to use in Mapper. <br></p>

<ol>

  <li>There are map servers such as the Georeferencer mentioned below
which can be accessed via the Internet. <br>
  </li>
  <li>If you have a web server on&nbsp; your local network, you can
have it serve map tiles.<br>
  </li>
  <li>You can install a web server on your PC to serve map tiles. <br>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Using Georeferencer to serve overlay map tiles.<br>
</h2>
<p>
One source of historical maps, in the US is the USGS. They have made
many historical topographic maps available on-line, free of charge,<samp></samp>
at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://ngmdb.usgs.gov/maps/TopoView/">USGS Map Store</a>.
<p>
While historical topographic maps may be very useful in locating
abandoned private right of way, these maps often do not identify city streets
(except for main thoroughfares). However, most cities over the years
have had numerous maps published showing far more detail than is
available on USGS topographic maps. 
One source of such maps is the <a href="http://www.davidrumsey.com/view/georeferenced-maps">David Rumsey
Map Collection</a>.
This collection has thousands of maps. More importantly, they are
georeferenced which means that any point on the map can be specified as

a latitude and longitude coordinate. This in turn allows them to be
displayed over Mapper's Google Maps or Open Street Map displays. <br>

<br>

Since these maps are available on line, it is possible to display them
as an overlay in Mapper. In order to do this, you must gather some
information and setup the map as an overlay in Mapper. <br>

<br>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column left" style="background-color:#EFDECD;">
<h2>Find a map</h2>  
<p>The first thing to do is to find a suitable map. The David Rumsey Map
Collection link has a feature, the <a href="https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/view/search?search=SUBMIT&q=St+Louis%2C+Mo&dateRangeStart=&dateRangeEnd=&sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort&QuickSearchA=QuickSearchA"> Luna Collection</a> that allows you to browse through the collection of georeferenced maps.
In the box in the upper right corner you can enter a place name like "Cincinnati, OHIO" 
Thumbnails of maps matching the search criteria will be displayed:<br>
<p><br> As an example, a 1901 map of Cincinnati has been located. Note that the thumbnail is highlighted.<br>

<hr align="center" size="2" width="50%">
<div class="row">
  <div class="column left" style="background-color:#EFDECD;">
 <h2>View Map</h2> 
<p>Once you have located a suitable map, click on the thumbnail to select it then click on "VIEW IN GEOREFERENCER" to display the map as an overlay on an <i>Open Streetmap</i> base map.
The selected map is displayed 
as an overlay on top of the Google Maps or Open Street Map. 
A slider control in the upper corner allows the opacity of the overlay to be varied. 
This is what Mapper can likewise do with this map overlay once it is configured.

<h2>Get Link</h2>
    <p>Now in the bar at the top, click on "This map". On the 
page that is displayed, there is a frame titled "Use in GIS apps" and click on "Get links".  Note you must have previously registered and are logged on.<br>

This is the HTML code that we need to extract some information to be
entered into the Update Overlay Information dialog. To open the dialog, select <i><b>Edit City Information</b></i> and click on <i><b>Add Overlay</b></i> button. The paste the clipboard data into the lower box titled "Url:"

<p>The dialog will now automatically fill in the other fields. If you wish, 
you may paste html into the Description field and you may have to edit the name to make it unique.

<h2>Save Overlay Info</h2>
 <p>Click on "OK" or "ADD" to add the new overlay to the list of
overlays, The overlay can now be selected for a City in the Edit City
Info dialog and then subsequently selected to be displayed from the
Overlays.<br>

<h2>Installing a map server on your PC.</h2>
Although these instructions are for installing a web server on your PC, they are generally applicable to any PC that will host a web sever.
Here is a tutorial on how to <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Set-up-your-very-own-Web-server/">Set Up Your Very Own Web Server!</a>

<h3>Ubuntu (Linux)</h3>

Here are instructions for creating a web server on your Ubuntu PC<span style="text-decoration: underline;">: </span><a href="https://www.vultr.com/docs/how-to-install-apache-mysql-and-php-on-ubuntu-16-04">How to Install Apache, MySQL and PHP on Ubuntu 16.04</a>.
The step to install MySQL is not necessary for implementing a map
server but the PHP is! However, installing MySQL does make it possible
to store the Mapper database using a MySQL server. <br>
<br>
The instructions call for installing a number of PHP add-ons. One add-on that you will definitely have to add is: 
<sudo apt-get install php7.0-sqlite3> which allows PHP to access SQLite3 databases.<br>
<p>Once you have installed the web server, you must create a directory "map_tiles" in the web server's root directory, "/var/www/html"
into this directory, copy the file "mbtiles.php" from the ../mapper_app/Resources" directory. This is the code that will 
actually serve the map tiles.
<h4>Downloading the overlays</h4>
There are several ways to create overlay 'mbtiles' files including programs like 
<a href="https://www.maptiler.com/">MapTiler</a>
or mapping programs like 
<a href="https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/creating_basemaps_with_qtiles.html">QGIS</a> 
or other mapping programs.
However, I have already created a number of overlays for St Louis, Mo; Cincinnatti, OH; Louisville, KY and Berlin, Germany.
They can be downloaded from Google Drive as zip files. They should be extracted into the "map_tiles" directory.
<ol>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B15wS9-3PzfYRHVDMEhYT1RLSDQ">St Louis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B15wS9-3PzfYOWtnS0s4YmU3YTg">St Louis 1912 topo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B15wS9-3PzfYYl9SaGNDbnQyREU">Cincinnatti, Ohio</a></li>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B15wS9-3PzfYUTlvYlNXaVRIalk">Louisville, KY</a></li>
</ol> 
A work of caution: These files are very large, so make sure you have plenty of disk space. 
<p>Once you have installed the mbtiles files in the "map_tiles"directory, enter this command in your web browser:
"http://localhost/map_tiles/mbtiles.php"
<p> This should result in a display like this: 
<p>
<code>St_Louis_1895|St Louis area in 1895|10|16|65|-90.2842,38.5711,-90.1617,38.6911|
St_Louis_1903|St Louis area at the time of the 1904 Worlds Fair|10|16|65|-90.3291,38.5256,-90.1025,38.7623|
St_Louis_historical_topo|St Louis area historical topo maps: Clayton 1933, Granite City 1940, St Charles 1927, Jefferson Barracks 1933, Columbia bottoms 1935, Creve Coeur 1933, Florissant 1935, Kirkwood 1940|8|17|65|-90.50056094676738,38.48416018141663,-90.12500117195425,39.00011566093108|
</code><p>This is the metadata that Mapper will use to determine what maps are available and their properties.

h<h4>Windows</h4>
If your operating system is Windows, it is also possible to setup a web server using 
Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS).
Instructions on how to do this for Windows 8 or 10 can be found at <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/112455/how-to-install-iis-8-on-windows-8/">here</a>
As in the instructions above for Linux, you must enable PHP on the new server, Then create a "map_tiles" directory in the same manner.
