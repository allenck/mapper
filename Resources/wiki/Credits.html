Locating information on long gone streetcar systems can be a difficult task. Obviously the first place one 
should investigate probably is the local library. Of course, the Internet should be searched and in many cases
informative books have been published about many systems. Railway museums in some cases have preserved company
records. Old newspapers can also be a source of information. Pinpointing the details about a line's route can 
be possible by viewing old maps. 
<p>
In the following paragraphs I will attempt to identify and credit sources of information for the cities referenced 
by Mapper.
</p>
<h1>Cities</h1>
<h2>St Louis, Mo</h2>
<p>
My primary source of information on St Louis was the route descriptions published each year in the city directories. 
A bit of photocopying pages from the city directories at the <b>St Louis County Library</b> got me started. 
<p>
The St Louis Railway Enthusiasts' newsletter on several occasions published notes accumulated by author Andrew D Young
for his books such as "<b><i>The St Louis Streetcar Story</i></b>". These notes detailed route changes and reasons by date making it 
possible to refine route changes identified in the city directories.
<p>
In 1992 St Louis railfan Raymond G. Gehl published several collections of maps and drawings of streetcar and interurban
lines by George Fehl III. Of particular interest were:
<b>Maps and Drawings of Street Railways and Electric Lines in St Louis, Mo</b> and
<b>Illinois Traction System -part three- <i>St Louis to Springfield St Louis Trackage Springfield Trackage</i> Comprehensive
 Traction Maps and Railway Illustrations</b> The level of detail in these maps is amazing. The former provides details about 
 long forgotten lines like the <i><b>St. Louis Lakewood & Grant Park Electric Railway</b></i>as well as maps of carbarns and the like.
</p>
<p>Old newspapers that can be accessed on-line via <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/" name="Newspapers.com">Newspapes.com</a> 
provide an important source of information on the construction and operation of early lines. 
<p>One interesting source of information was <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/rc01001392/" name="Compton & Drys Pictorial  
View of St Louis, 1875" title="Pictorial St. Louis, the great metropolis of the Mississippi valley; a topographical survey 
drawn in perspective A.D. 1875,">Compton & Dry's</a>
This was particularly valuable for locating details on early streetcar lines. The Compton & Dry's map is also 
available from: <a href="http://www.davidrumsey.com/maps890020-24321.html"> David Rumsey Map Collection</a>
</p>
<h2>Louisville, Ky</h2>
<p>Much of the information I have on Louisville consists of maps and drawings by early Kentucky Railway Museum member
 Ernest K. Gibson
which along with other data collected by historian George H. Yater and is now stored in the archives at the <b>University of Louisville Library
</b>. Author Martin E. Biemer has made extensive use of this and additional information in his book
 <a href="https://www.butlerbooks.com/louisvilles-street-railways.html" 
 title="Louisville's Street Railways – and How They Shaped the City's Growth">https://www.butlerbooks.com/Louisville's-street-railways.html</a>
<h2>Cincinnati, Oh</h2>
<p>
Much information on Cincinnati's streetcars was derived from several publications produced by Richard M. Wagner
 and Roy J. wright, such as: <a href="https://www.abebooks.com/first-edition/CINCINNATI-STREETCARS-No-2-INCLINES-Ricahrd/30772487420/bd" 
 title="CINCINNATI STREETCARS No. 2 THE INCLINES">CINCINNATI STREETCARS No. 2 THE INCLINES</a> available from Amazon and
 other sellers.
 <p>A map created by <a href="https://www.jjakucyk.com/">Jeffrey B. Jakucyk</a> was of considerable help in locating routes.
<h2>Indianapolis, In</h2>
<p>
 Fortunately, Indianapolis' City Directories published after 1900 provided information on streetcar routes each year. More
 detailed information is available in a book authored by Jerry Marlette, <b><i>Indianapolis Railways a Complete History</i></b>
 Of all the sources I have utilized, Jerry Marlette's book provides the additional detail such as when track 
 segments were constructed.
</p>
<h2>Berlin Germany</h2>
In my several visits to Berlin, I have explored many of Berlin's existing streetcar routes, particularly in the 
former East Berlin where streetcars were never deemed as outdated as opposed to West Berlin where all routes were abandoned 
in the mid 60's. Looking for information on Berlin's streetcars, I ran across 
<a href="https://www.berlin-straba.de/">Berliner Strassenbahn</a> a very comprehensive website (in German of course)) that
 among other things, details 
day by day changes (Nachkriegsgeschichte) to routes starting after the end of WWII. Recently, this has been expanded with additional information on route 
changes during the war years, from 1941 onward. Also, the current <a href="bvg.de">Berlin Transit Authority</a> has a lot of curent
 information.
<p>
Another Berlin source is <a href="https://www.berliner-linienchronik.de/">DIE CHRONIK für Berlins Nahverkehr von 1858 bis 2024</a>.
<p>
 Through a friend in Berlin, I became familiar with <a href="https://jenikirbyhistory.getarchive.net/media/straube-plan-berlin-1910-4f9a5e">maps of Berlin</a> circa 1910 by cartographer Julius Straube. These maps are
 exquisitely detailed, even showing streetcar track layouts in the streets! I have georeferenced this map and use it as an overlay.
