<br>
Source is available if you want to modify the program or run it on a Linux system. Mapper source can be downloaded 
from GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/allenck/mapper">https://github.com/allenck/mapper</a><br><br>
<br>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
Mapper uses QT as a programming framework. QT can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-2">Download Qt</a>
The default Qt configuration should be sufficient to compile and run Mapper. Mapper utilizes Sqlite3 to store data.Qt includes a 
version of Sqlite3. Qt has an application called <b>Qt Maintenance Tool</b> which can be used to download different versions 
as well as optional libraries and extensions. Here is a screenshot of loading Qt on my computer:

 <p>
 Installing Qt does not install everything necessary to compile and test Mapper. Some of the other libraries needed are:
 <ul>
 <li>Essentials which includes the make system, compilers and debuggers. On linux, this can be downloaded with
 <i>sudo apt install build-essential</i> </li>
 <li><i>sudo apt-get install g++ </i></li>
 <li><i>sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev</i></li>
 <li><i>sudo apt-get install libldl2</i> </li>

 </ul>
 </p>
<p>
If you wish to use Sql Server or MySql databases, you may also have to
compile QT with plugins for those database types. However Qt, by default, includes a plugin for ODBC and ODBC drivers 
for MySql and Microsoft Sql Server are available. 
Even if an ODBC driver for other databases such as Postgresql is available, be aware that Mapper's internal SQL commands 
may have to be tailored to the requirements of that database type.
<p>
Mapper was originally developed using version 4.8 of QT. However there
are newer versions of QT that have some enhancements that are
desirable. At the present time; December 2023, Mapper has been compiled with version 6.4.2 and 6.6.1.
 QT as ofQt version 5.7 no longer supports QWebkit
and instead offers QWebEngine as an alternative. Mapper compiled on QT
versions later than 5.4 will use the QWebEngine module instead of
QWebKit. QWebkit and QWebEngine provide the ability of Mapper to
display a map using Google Maps in a web widget.<br>
<p>
Windows users will have to also install Microsoft Visual Studio&nbsp;
on their computers. Note that there are two varieties of QT for
Windows, one requiring Visual Studio and the other MinGW. I used
Visual Studio 2008 for QT 4.8 but newer versions of Visual Studio(2010
&amp; 2012)
are available. Also when downloading QT, look for the "Archive for old
versions" link which will let you download either a QT version 4 or 5.
The version of Microsoft Visual studio that you will need will in turn
depend on which version of QT you are using. For example, QT 5.6.1
comes compiled with MSVC 2013 or MSVC 2015 or MinGw while QT version
5.4 comes compiled with MSVC 2010 or MSVC 2013 or MinGw. Qt currently requires MSVC 2019.<br>
<br>
<h4>Sqlite</h4>
<p>
Although Qt comes with SQLite3 support built-in, Mapper uses some user defined sql functions which requires
downloading and compiling SQLite3 from source and creating a library. It is reccommended that the same 
version of SQLite3 be used that QT uses. Assuming that you have downloaded the Qt source files. the version
info can be found in sqlite3.h in <i>Qt/6.8.0/Src/qtbase/3rdparty/sqlite</i> where "Qt" is the location on your PC where
Qt was installed. Also substitute "6.8.0" with the version number of Qt you are using.
<p>
The particular SQLite3 Amalgamation source files can be downloaded from: 
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/download.html" name="SQLite Amalgamation"></a>
<p>
On Linux, the SQLite3 lirary can be compiled with this shell script:
<ul>
<li>#! /bin/sh</li>
<li></li>
<li>gcc -shared sqlite3.c -ldl -o libsqlite3.so -lpthread -fPIC  \</li>
<li>   -DSQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA \</li>
<li>   -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3 \</li>
<li>   -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_PARENTHESIS \</li>
<li>   -DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5 \</li>
<li>   -DSQLITE_ENABLE_JSON1 \</li>
 <li>  -DSQLITE_ENABLE_RTREE \</li>
<li>   -DSQLITE_OMIT_COMPLETE</li>
 </ul>
 The resulting <i>libsqlite3.so</i> library should be copied to some place such as /usr/local/lib.

<h4>Google Maps</h4>
Google requires that programs using the Google Maps API must have an API key which can be obtained at
 <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key"> Use API keys</a>
 No API keys for Google Maps can be stored in source files in GitHub. In fact, Google will 
 invalidate them if they are included in files! Several html files dynamically substitute the actual API key 
 contained in the apikey.js file. apikey.js is a one line source file containing your API key as a constant: <i>var apikey="MY_API_KEY";</i>
 
  NOTE that git will ignore the apikey.js in the <i>./mapper_app/Resources</i>.


<h5>Macintosh</h5>
QT is available on the Macintosh. As of December 2023, Mapper has also been successfully implemented on MacOS. <br>
