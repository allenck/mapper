<big>Route</big>
<dl>

  <dd>A route is defined as one or more <span style="font-style: italic;">Segments</span>. A route has a name and a
route number. A route exists for a particular company for some date
range. A route can also have a traction type property such as
"Electric", "cable", "horse or mule", etc. <br>
  </dd>
  <dt style="font-style: italic;"><big>Route Number</big></dt>
  <dd>Route numbers define a particular route, e.g. "70" for the St.
Louis "Grand" line. While route numbers were not used on the cars, for
example, in St, Louis before 1928, I have used them for earlier
manifestions of the same route by by United Railways or St. Louis
Transit to maintain continuity. So, route numbers may or may not
actually refer to a route number displayed on a streetcar, unless the
company actually used route numbers. Route numbers may be
alphanumeric.&nbsp; A route number need not be changed when a route
name changes. For example, United Railways had a "Olive-Delmar" line
which was essentially the same as SLPS's 10-Delmar so I use the route
number "10 for both. <br>
  </dd>
  <dt style="font-style: italic;"><big>Segment</big></dt>
  <dd>A segment describes a part of a route. Segments have a start <span style="font-style: italic;">Point</span> and an end <span style="font-style: italic;">Point</span>. Segments can be used by many
different routes. Generally a segment runs from a start point where it
may intersect with another segment to it's end point where it may
intersect with another segment. A segment has a "name" property which
uniquely describes it. The generally used syntax for a segment name is:
"&lt;street&gt;, &lt;from street&gt; to &lt;to street&gt;", e.g. "12th,
Delmar to Olive". If there are no intersections with other segments
between the start and end, the name may also be represented like this:
"Boyle &amp; Olive to Maryland &amp; Kingshighway". The first example
is preferred. It is better to restrict segments to a single street as
this makes it easier to locate a segment when doing route
maintenance.&nbsp; Segments also have&nbsp; "oneWay" and tracks
properties. "Tracks" must be 1 or 2. "OneWay" is either "Y" (yes) or
"N" (no). 2 track segments are never oneway. Single tracks are usually
one way unless the segment is travelled in either direction. A final
property, "type" describes the type of construction: "Streee", "Private
R/W", "Subway", etc. <em>Note</em>: Pysically, a particular streetcar
line may operate on a street that has double track but only goes one
way on this street. In that case, the track is single (1) and one way.
This was often true in the downtown area where streecar lines "looped"
around the block. <br>
  </dd>
  <dt style="font-style: italic;"><big>Point</big></dt>
  <dd>A segment always has 2 or more points that describe Each point is
the latitude and longitude on the map. The collection of points is used
to draw the segment on the map. <br>
  </dd>
  <dt style="font-style: italic;"><big>Overlay</big></dt>
  <dd>An overlay is a map that can be shown over the base map, Google
Maps, OpenStreet Map or a user defined map. An opacity control is
displayed on the map surface allowing the opacity of the overlay to be
modified. Overlays are a great tool that can be used to find a
long-gone streetcar right-of-way on a historical map such as can be
downloaded from the <a href="http://store.usgs.gov/b2c_usgs/usgs/maplocator/%28ctype=catalogEntry&amp;xcm=r3standardpitrex_prd&amp;carea=%24ROOT&amp;layout=6_1_61_50_2&amp;uiarea=2%29/.do">USGS
store</a>. However the creation of an overlay is quite involved and
requires the creation of "tiles" on a web server. <br>
  </dd>
  <dt style="font-style: italic;"><big>User Map</big></dt>
  <dd>Like overlays, a map can be "tiled" and loaded on a web server to
be used as a "base map" instead of Google Maps or OpenStreetMap". <br>
  </dd>
  <dt style="font-style: italic;"><big>Station</big></dt>
  <dd>The term "station" is used to define a railroad station,
streetcar stop or bus stop. "stations" are defined for a route and can
be displayed on the map when a route is drawn. <br>
  </dd>
  <dt style="font-style: italic;"><big>Route Comment</big></dt>
  <dd>Route Comments are notes keyed to a route and a date and can be
used to display information such as a rerouting on a particular
date.&nbsp; The display of Route Comments can be turned on or off as
desired. <br>
  </dd>
  <dt style="font-style: italic;"><big>Terminal Markers</big></dt>
  <dd>Terminal markers can be defined for a route one for the start of
a route and one for the end. The display of terminal markers can be
turned on or off as desired.&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt style="font-style: italic;"><big>Company</big></dt>
  <dd>A route is operated by a "Company". A company has start and end
date properties. A given route can only exist during a company's
existence. <br>
</dd><dt style="font-style: italic;"><big>City</big></dt>
  <dd>"City" as used here refers to a location for which a database exists, e.g. St. Louis, Louisville, Kentucky, Berlin, Germany, etc. <br>
  </dd>
  <dt style="font-style: italic;"><big>Connection</big></dt>
  <dd>Each city has one or more connections which correspond to unique
databases for that city. A connection may be a SQLite database, MySql
database or Sql Server databases. MySql and SqlServer databases can
either be on the local machine or on a remote server. SQLite databases
can only reside on the same computer as the one where Mapper is
running.To access a MySql or Sql Server database you must have MySqL or ODBC software installed on your computer.  <br>
